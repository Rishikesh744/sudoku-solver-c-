# Sudoku Solver
- A simple sudoku solver in C++ (COMSC165 Final Project).
- You can download this code and try my algorithm with other Sudoku boards.
- All necessary explanation can be found in presentation.pptx
## There is no unsolvable sudoku board (The board has to be prepared incorrectly for my algorithm to not be able to solve this.) 
## This method uses brute force meaning that it is trying each way to solve the "puzzle"
