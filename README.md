# Sudoku Solver
- A simple sudoku solver in C++ (COMSC165 Final Project).
- You can download this code and try my algorithm with other Sudoku boards.
- All necessary explanation can be found in presentation.pptx
### - There is no unsolvable sudoku board (The board has to be prepared incorrectly for my algorithm to not be able to solve this. After trying all possible inputs if my algorithm still cannot solve it which is "ALL" of the possible number combinations) It says that the board is prepared falsely. 
### - This method uses Brute Force and Backtracing meaning that it is trying each way to solve the "puzzle" with "ALL" of the possible combinations.
### - Clearer Explanation of Brute Force and Backtracing can be found in the powerpoint.
### - The human limit might be 100-1000 iterations but a human cannot solve a 300.000 iteration Sudoku. Therefore the definition of an unsolvable sudoku can only be a "falsely prepared sudoku board" which can be seen in input4.txt
