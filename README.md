# Sudoku Solver
- A simple sudoku solver in C++ (COMSC165 Final Project).
- You can download this code and try my algorithm with other Sudoku boards.
- All necessary explanation can be found in presentation.pptx
### - There is no unsolvable sudoku board (The board has to be prepared incorrectly for my algorithm to not be able to solve this.) 
### - This method uses Brute Force and Backtracing meaning that it is trying each way to solve the "puzzle" 
### - The human limit might be 100-1000 iteration but a human cannot solve a 300.000 iteration sudoku.Therefore the definition of an unsolvable sudoku can only be a falsely prepared sudoku board which can be seen in input4.txt
